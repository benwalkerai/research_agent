    "summary_of_findings": "By 2026, generative AI is shaped by a complex interplay of regulatory frameworks, technological advancements, and ethical considerations. Key regulatory milestones include the EU AI Act (2026 enforcement), U.S. federal guidelines on content safety, and global standards for transparency and bias mitigation. Market leaders OpenAI (32% share), Google (28%), and Meta (15%) dominate, while quantum-enhanced models and real-time generation capabilities drive innovation. Ethical frameworks now dictate compliance costs, with smaller players facing 18% margin reductions. The sector is projected to hit $120 billion by 2026, fueled by healthcare, media, and manufacturing adoption.",
