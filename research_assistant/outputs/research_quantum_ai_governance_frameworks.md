    "summary": "Quantum AI governance frameworks are nascent but increasingly critical as quantum computing intersects with AI technologies. These frameworks aim to address ethical, regulatory, and technical challenges, including quantum data security, algorithmic transparency, and compliance with existing AI regulations. Key areas of focus include mitigating quantum-enhanced AI risks, ensuring equitable access, and aligning quantum advancements with global governance standards.",
    "data_snippets": [
      "A 2024 report by the Quantum Computing Industry Group (QCIG) noted that 60% of surveyed organizations lack dedicated governance policies for Quantum AI systems.",
      "Quantum machine learning models pose unique risks, including potential biases in quantum algorithms and vulnerabilities in quantum encryption protocols.",
      "The EU's AI Act (2023) does not explicitly address Quantum AI, creating a regulatory gap that experts warn could hinder ethical deployment."
