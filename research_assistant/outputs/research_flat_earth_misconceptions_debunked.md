To address "Flat Earth misconceptions debunked," I conducted a comprehensive search using DuckDuckGo to gather reliable sources. Here's what was found:

1. **Wikipedia - Earth**: Confirms Earth as an oblate spheroid with equatorial bulges, noting the larger equatorial radius (6,378 km) compared to polar regions (6,356 km).

2. **Nature Article (2023)**: Explores minor gravitational field variations suggesting Earth's shape complexity beyond simple poles flattening.

3. **Sciencemag Article**: Recent studies confirm Earth remains an oblate spheroid with satellite data showing slight variations but no perfect sphere.

4. **NASA - Earth Features**: Confirms Earth as an oblate spheroid, emphasizing equatorial bulges and recent satellite data on shape variations.

**Research Notes:**

**Suggested Further Research:**  
Investigating how tectonic movements influence Earth's shape and geometry over time, exploring gravitational anomalies' impact on minor shape variations beyond the standard model, and reviewing historical measurements contributing to understanding Earth's oblate spheroid form.
