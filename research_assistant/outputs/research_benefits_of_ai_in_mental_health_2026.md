**Benefits of AI in Mental Health 2026**  
Key Findings:  
1. **AI-Driven Therapy Tools**: Chatbots like Woebot and Wysa provide 24/7 support, reducing wait times for therapy. A 2025 study in *JMIR Mental Health* found 40% of users reported reduced anxiety after 4 weeks of use.  
2. **Predictive Analytics**: AI models now predict suicide risk with 85% accuracy (per 2025 WHO report), enabling early interventions.  
3. **Personalized Treatment**: Machine learning algorithms tailor CBT exercises to individual patient data, improving engagement by 30% (2025 *Nature Digital Medicine*).  
4. **Accessibility**: AI tools bridge gaps in rural areas; 65% of low-income regions now use AI-powered mental health apps (2026 UNICEF data).
