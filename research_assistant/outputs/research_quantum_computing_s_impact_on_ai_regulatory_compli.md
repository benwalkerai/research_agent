    "Summary of Findings": "Quantum computing’s impact on AI regulatory compliance is reshaping ethical and legal frameworks through accelerated computational capabilities, novel risk scenarios, and paradigm shifts in data governance. Key developments include the integration of quantum machine learning (QML) into AI systems, which challenges existing compliance standards by introducing quantum-specific risks (e.g., quantum data privacy, algorithmic transparency in quantum models). Regulatory bodies are beginning to address these issues, with the EU AI Act and IEEE standards incorporating quantum AI ethics. Challenges include quantum-enhanced adversarial attacks, redefinition of 'fairness' in quantum algorithms, and cross-border compliance in quantum-cloud AI systems.",
