### **2. Regulatory & Ethical Developments**  
- **EU AI Act Implementation (2026)**:  
  - Full enforcement of risk-based regulation for high-risk systems (e.g., biometric identification, law enforcement).  
  - Compliance deadlines: 2024–2026 for facial recognition, recruitment tools, and other high-risk applications.  

- **Global AI Governance Frameworks**:  
  - Proposals for **standardized ethical audits**, **cross-border data sharing**, and **international safety standards** (World Economic Forum).  
  - **IEEE 2026 ethics guidelines**: Emphasize transparency, accountability, and bias mitigation in AI systems.  

- **Corporate Responsibility**:  
  - **Google’s 2026 update**: Prioritizes third-party audits, reduced environmental impact, and equitable AI access.  
  - **MIT Technology Review**: Predicts regulatory pressure on developers to embed **explainable AI (XAI)** and ethical risk assessments into product lifecycles.
