To address the task of gathering information on the impact of ChatGPT updates, here is an organized approach:

1. **Initial Research with DuckDuckGo Search**: Conduct searches for "Impact of ChatGPT updates on user interaction" and "AI performance impact". This will provide a broad overview.

2. **Extract Key Findings**: Review the search results to identify trends in user interaction metrics, AI performance improvements, and any notable studies or articles.

3. **Seek Specific Information**: If unclear aspects are found, use the Ask question tool to obtain specific statistics, quotes, or detailed information from relevant sources.

4. **Identify Sub-topics for Further Research**: Look into related areas such as changes in API availability, pricing models, integration with other tools, and user feedback. These can be listed in a JSON block under 'SUGGESTED_FURTHER_RESEARCH'.

5. **Format Sources**: Ensure all URLs are formatted as Markdown links.

By following these steps, the information will be gathered systematically, ensuring a comprehensive report is produced.
