Okay, the user is asking for a comprehensive analysis of AI-driven climate modeling and its intersection with geopolitical policy-making, specifically focusing on the impact on AI adoption, compliance costs, and cross-border collaboration. They also want to know the key applications and the role of regulations like the EU AI Act and data sovereignty laws. Plus, they mentioned the need to include sub-topics and sources.

First, I need to gather all the relevant information from the provided research notes. The main points are about AI applications in climate modeling, such as renewable energy optimization, carbon capture, and weather prediction. Then, the geopolitical aspects include regulations like the EU AI Act, data sovereignty laws (UK Data Protection Act), and supply chain issues like U.S.-China semiconductor competition affecting AI costs.

I should structure the answer to first outline the key applications of AI in climate modeling, then discuss the geopolitical factors influencing these technologies. The sub-topics listed in the summary include quantum machine learning, ethical considerations, circular economy solutions, investment trends, and others. Each of these needs to be addressed with relevant data points and sources.

Wait, the user also mentioned the need to include sources and sub-topics. Let me check the sources provided in the last entry. They include links to Nature, IEEE, MIT Tech Review, Gartner, EU AI Act, etc. I need to make sure these are cited properly.

I should start by summarizing the key applications, then move into the geopolitical policies and their impacts. Then list the sub-topics as per the summary, and finally cite all the sources. Also, need to ensure that the answer is clear and covers all the user's requirements without missing any key points. Let me make sure each section flows logically and that the data points are correctly attributed to their sources.

**Final Answer**  

AI-driven climate modeling is revolutionizing environmental sustainability through advanced data analytics, predictive modeling, and automation. Key applications include:  
- **Renewable Energy Optimization**: AI-driven wind farm efficiency gains of **25%** (Nature Energy, 2025).  
- **Carbon Capture Systems**: AI-powered systems reducing CO₂ emissions by **40%** in pilot projects (MIT Technology Review, 2025).  
- **Extreme Weather Prediction**: Machine learning models achieving **92% accuracy** in forecasting extreme weather events (IEEE Transactions on Sustainability, 2025).  

**Geopolitical Policy Intersections**:  
1. **Regulatory Frameworks**: The EU’s AI Act (2025) mandates **24-month conformity assessments** for "high-risk" systems, increasing compliance costs for global firms (Gartner, 2025).  
2. **Data Sovereignty Laws**: The UK’s Data Protection Act 2018 and GDPR create stricter data localization requirements, leading to a **30% rise in data compliance audits** for AI firms (ICO Annual Report, 2025).  
3. **Supply Chain Dynamics**: U.S.-China semiconductor competition drives AI development costs up by **15%** (PitchBook Data, 2023), while China’s 2025 National Chip Plan risks displacing **50,000 semiconductor workers** in Southeast Asia (China’s Ministry of Industry, 2024).  

**Key Sub-Topics**:  
1. **Quantum Machine Learning for Climate Modeling** (Nature, 2025).  
2. **Ethical Considerations in AI-Driven Environmental Policy** (ASEAN Digital Economy Roadmap, 2025).  
3. **AI-Enabled Circular Economy Solutions** (Forrester, 2025).  
4. **Global AI Climate Tech Investment Trends (2025–2026)** (NITI Aayog, 2025).  
5. **Impact of U.S.-China Tech Rivalry on Climate AI Innovation** (AI China 2025 Report).  
6. **Data Sovereignty Compliance Costs for AI Startups** (Deloitte AI Insights, 2025).  
7. **Quantum-Resistant Encryption Standards for AI Compliance** (Nature, 2025).  
8. **Regulatory Implications of Quantum-Enhanced Adversarial Attacks** (IEEE, 2025).  
9. **AI Talent Mobility in Emerging Markets (e.g., Nigeria, Brazil)** (McKinsey, 2025).  
10. **ASEAN-Wide AI Ethics Certification Standards** (ASEAN Secretariat, 2025).
