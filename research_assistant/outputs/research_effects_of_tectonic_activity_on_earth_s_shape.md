**Effects of Tectonic Activity on Earth's Shape**

Tectonic activity significantly influences Earth's shape through several mechanisms:

1. **Mountain Formation**: Movements of tectonic plates lead to the formation of mountain ranges like the Himalayas, which contribute to deviations from Earth's ideal oblate spheroid shape.

2. **Gravity Effects**: Tectonic movements cause mass redistribution, affecting gravitational pull and sea levels. This can result in changes in the geoid, the equipotential surface of Earth's gravity field.

3. **Satellite Monitoring**: Missions like GRACE and GRACE-FO provide data on Earth's gravity field variations, which are influenced by tectonic activities, helping to measure shape changes.

4. **Mantle Convection**: This process indirectly affects plate movements, potentially influencing future tectonic activity and Earth's shape through changes in mantle dynamics.

5. **Isostasy**: The Earth's crust floats on the mantle; changes in load due to tectonic activities can cause subsidence or uplift, affecting overall shape.

6. **Long-term Geological Processes**: Over millions of years, tectonic forces shape mountains and valleys, contributing subtle variations detectable through geological studies.

In summary, tectonic activity causes minor but measurable changes in Earth's shape through mass redistribution, gravitational effects, and geological processes, which can be observed using satellite data and studied through plate tectonics research.
