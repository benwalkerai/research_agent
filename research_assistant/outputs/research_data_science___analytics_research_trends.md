Thought: I have gathered various articles and resources discussing Data Science & Analytics Research Trends. The key themes include AI and Machine Learning, automation, edge computing, data privacy and ethics, and cloud computing.

Action:
- Analyze the findings from the search results.
- Create a summary of the main research trends in data science and analytics for the next few years.
- Suggest additional resources or studies to further investigate these trends.
