    "Summary of Findings": "Global economic trends between 2025-2026 have significantly influenced the AI job market, with increased public and private sector investment driving growth. Key trends include the rise of quantum computing and agentic AI systems, which are reshaping industry demands. Economic recovery post-2023 has accelerated AI adoption, particularly in healthcare, finance, and manufacturing, while regulatory frameworks like the EU AI Act and NIST guidelines are shaping compliance-driven job roles. Displacement in repetitive roles is countered by growth in AI ethics, quantum computing, and federated learning expertise.",
