    "summary_of_findings": "The cost-benefit analysis of final quality control reveals a complex interplay between technological investment, operational efficiency, and regulatory compliance. Automated Final Inspection Systems (AFIS) leverage AI, IoT, and robotics to reduce defect rates by 30-40% (Industry Report 2023) while cutting inspection time by 40% (Manufacturing Today, 2024). However, implementation costs for AFIS reach $8.2 billion globally (2024) with a 15.3% CAGR through 2030 (MarketsandMarkets). Regulatory compliance, particularly in healthcare (FDA traceability mandates) and pharmaceuticals (75% AI adoption for document verification), incurs additional costs but avoids penalties averaging 68% of annual revenue (Deloitte, 2024). Ethical considerations, including 20% job displacement in quality control and algorithmic bias risks (MIT, 2023), add hidden costs to the analysis.",
