    "summary_of_findings": "By 2026, the evolution of AI regulatory frameworks and standards has been marked by global harmonization efforts, stringent compliance mandates, and the integration of ethical AI principles into technical standards. Key developments include the full enforcement of the EU AI Act in 2026, the adoption of UNESCO’s global AI ethics recommendations, and the establishment of AI audit standards by ISO and OECD. Regulatory bodies such as the FDA and FAA have mandated transparency and traceability in AI-driven decision-making, particularly in healthcare and aerospace. The rise of open-source auditing platforms like EthiX and the proliferation of AI ethics boards in tech firms reflect a shift toward accountability. Challenges persist in balancing innovation with oversight, particularly in areas like agentic AI systems and quantum machine learning integration.",
