Thought: I have found several relevant documents and web pages related to the McKinsey State of AI Report 2025. The key points from these sources indicate that:

- Almost all survey respondents (88%) say their organizations are using AI.
- Only one-third of all respondents say they are scaling their AI programs across their organization.
- Just 6% qualify as high performers in terms of enterprise-scale impact.

Based on this information, I can now summarize the findings for the final answer.

Action: None
