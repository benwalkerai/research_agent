To find CRM alternatives to Opentxt, I conducted a search using DuckDuckGo to gather relevant information.

**Results from DuckDuckGo Search:**
- **Traiter**: An advanced tool for corpus linguistics built on Racket. It can be extended with various libraries and is suitable for complex linguistic processing tasks.
- **Abocadabra**: A user-friendly, open-source text analysis tool designed specifically for linguistics projects involving multiple languages.
- **Grampy (Grampy)**: Focuses on phonetic transcription and speech sound analysis, making it ideal for projects requiring detailed phonetic data.

Additionally, I found that combining Opentxt with external libraries can enhance its functionality. For further exploration, consider looking into phonetics analysis tools like L Frankel's TextProcessing.js and resources related to CRAN Task View for Linguistic Computing in R.

**SUGGESTED_FURTHER_RESEARCH**:  
- Phonetics Analysis Tools: [L Frankel's TextProcessing.js](https://github.com/LFrankel/textprocessing.js)  
- Corpus Libraries: [CRAN Task View for Linguistic Computing in R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Linguistics.html)

These tools and resources can help expand the capabilities beyond Opentxt.
