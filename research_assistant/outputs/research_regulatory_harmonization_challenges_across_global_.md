    "Summary of Findings": "Regulatory harmonization challenges across global AI markets stem from divergent legal frameworks, national priorities, and geopolitical tensions. Key issues include conflicting data privacy laws (e.g., GDPR vs. U.S. CLOUD Act), varying AI safety standards (e.g., EU AI Act vs. U.S. NIST guidelines), and fragmented international cooperation. The lack of unified governance creates compliance burdens for multinational firms, stifles innovation, and exacerbates 'regulatory arbitrage.' Recent efforts, such as the OECD AI Policy Observatory and the EU’s proposed Global AI Regulation, aim to address these gaps but face resistance from regions prioritizing sovereignty (e.g., China’s AI Development Plan 2025).",
