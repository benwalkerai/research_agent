  "Research Notes": {
    "Summary of Findings": "The UK's data sovereignty laws, including the UK Data Protection Act 2018 and the Digital Services Act (DSA), have significant implications for AI job markets. These laws mandate data localization, enhanced data governance, and stricter compliance requirements, reshaping demand for specialized roles in AI ethics, data security, and regulatory compliance. Key impacts include increased hiring in data sovereignty compliance officers, cybersecurity experts, and AI auditors, while also creating challenges for cross-border AI collaboration and potential job displacement in data science roles due to higher operational costs.",
