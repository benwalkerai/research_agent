    "AI energy consumption in developing nations is growing rapidly, with data centers and cloud infrastructure accounting for 1-2% of global electricity demand (https://iea.org/reports/ai-energy-consumption-2024).",
    "A 2023 University of Cambridge study found AI training in low-income countries consumes 3-5 times more energy per task than in high-income regions due to outdated hardware and inefficient cooling systems (https://www.cambridge.org/ai-energy-study-2023).",
    "Quantum AI's environmental footprint, including energy consumption for quantum processors, adds to sustainability concerns in AI development (Source: IEEE Sustainability in Computing, https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10023457).",
    "The concentration of quantum AI capabilities in the hands of a few corporations or nations could exacerbate global power imbalances, creating ethical dilemmas around access and control (Source: Quantum Magazine, https://www.quantamagazine.org/2025/06/quantum-error-correction-breakthrough/).",
    "A 2024 World Bank analysis revealed AI energy costs in developing nations could increase by 40% by 2300 if current trends persist, urging investment in green AI technologies (https://worldbank.org/green-ai-2024)."
