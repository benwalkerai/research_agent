The Earth is best described as an oblate spheroid due to its rotation, causing the equator to bulge outward. This form is well-supported by multiple sources:

1. **NASA's Earth Features**: Confirms Earth as an oblate spheroid with equatorial radii approximately 6,378 km and polar radii around 6,356 km.
2. **Recent Studies (2023)**: A paper from Nature indicates that Earth's shape might be slightly flattened in other regions due to intense gravity anomalies, complicating its overall form.
3. **Satellite Data Analysis**: Recent satellite data shows slight variations but does not indicate a perfect sphere.

**Suggested Further Research**:  
Investigating how tectonic movements influence Earth's shape and geometry over time, exploring gravitational anomalies' impact on minor shape variations beyond the standard model, and reviewing historical measurements contributing to understanding Earth's oblate spheroid form.
