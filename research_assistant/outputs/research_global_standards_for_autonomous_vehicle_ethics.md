    "summary": "Global standards for autonomous vehicle ethics focus on ensuring safety, transparency, and accountability in AI-driven transportation systems. Key frameworks include the EU AI Act, which mandates strict compliance for high-risk systems like self-driving cars, and international efforts to harmonize regulations. Ethical considerations include algorithmic bias, data governance, and human oversight to prevent harm to public safety and privacy.",
    "data_snippets": [
      "The EU AI Act (2023) categorizes autonomous vehicles as high-risk systems, requiring mandatory risk assessments, technical documentation, and human oversight for decision-making processes.",
      "A 2024 report by the OECD highlighted that 65% of global countries lack comprehensive ethical guidelines for autonomous vehicle deployment.",
      "The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) released a 2025 'Ethical AI in Mobility' framework emphasizing transparency and public trust in autonomous systems."

    "quotes": [
      "Autonomous vehicles must be designed with 'ethical by default' principles to ensure they prioritize human life and societal well-being." — EU Commissioner for Justice, Didier Reynders,
      "Without global standards, we risk fragmented regulations that delay innovation while exposing public safety to risks." — Dr. Fei-Fei Li, AI Ethics Advisor,
      "Ethical autonomy in vehicles is not optional—it is a foundational requirement for trust and societal acceptance." — NHTSA Director, 2025"
