  "Research Notes": {
    "Summary of Findings": "Upskilling and reskilling opportunities for AI professionals from 2025 to 2026 are driven by rapid advancements in quantum computing, agentic AI, federated learning, and regulatory compliance. Quantum computing integration demands expertise in hybrid quantum-classical models, while agentic AI systems require skills in autonomy and real-time decision-making. Federated learning growth highlights demand for privacy-preserving techniques, and regulatory frameworks like the EU AI Act and NIST guidelines necessitate training in ethical AI compliance. These trends create opportunities for professionals to specialize in quantum AI, ethical AI audits, and federated learning architecture.",
