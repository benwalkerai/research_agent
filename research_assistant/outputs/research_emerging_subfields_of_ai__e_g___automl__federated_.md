    "Summary of Findings": "Emerging subfields of AI such as AutoML, federated learning, and quantum machine learning are reshaping job roles by 2026. Quantum computing enhances AI's computational power for drug discovery and optimization, while agentic AI systems evolve toward autonomy, integrating quantum and neuromorphic computing for real-time decision-making. Federated learning enables privacy-preserving data collaboration across industries. Ethical AI frameworks, regulatory mandates (e.g., EU AI Act, NIST guidelines), and global economic trends are driving demand for compliance roles, quantum AI expertise, and federated learning specialists. The AI job market sees displacement in repetitive roles countered by growth in ethical AI, quantum computing, and privacy-preserving techniques.",
