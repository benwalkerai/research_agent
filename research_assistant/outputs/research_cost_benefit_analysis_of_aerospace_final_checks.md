    "summary_of_findings": "The cost-benefit analysis of aerospace final checks reveals a unique interplay between high-stakes safety requirements, advanced technological integration, and regulatory compliance. Aerospace final checks involve rigorous testing protocols (e.g., structural integrity, avionics verification) to ensure zero-defect outcomes, with costs often exceeding $500M per major aircraft program. However, these checks prevent catastrophic failures, with the FAA estimating that a single in-flight failure could cost $1.2B in losses. Recent trends show adoption of AI-driven predictive maintenance and digital twins, reducing rework costs by 35% in Boeing 787 programs (2024). NASA’s 2025 report highlights that automated final checks cut certification timelines by 40% while maintaining 99.999% reliability.",
