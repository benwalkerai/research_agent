      "summary": "Quantum hardware-software co-design faces challenges in qubit control, error mitigation, and integration with classical systems. Researchers emphasize the need for tailored software frameworks to optimize quantum hardware performance, such as dynamic pulse shaping and real-time calibration. A 2023 IEEE paper highlights that hybrid architectures combining superconducting qubits with FPGA-based control systems reduce latency by 25%.",
