  "Research Notes": {
    "Summary of Findings": "Global AI talent migration post-2025 has been driven by geopolitical shifts, corporate expansion, and regional policy incentives. Key trends include a surge in talent movement from Europe to Asia-Pacific due to relaxed regulations and funding, increased remote work enabling global mobility, and the rise of AI startups in Africa and Latin America. The U.S. and China remain top destinations, while the EU faces talent outflows due to stricter AI governance frameworks. Migration patterns also reflect the growth of specialized fields like quantum AI and generative models, with professionals relocating to hubs offering research infrastructure and funding.",
