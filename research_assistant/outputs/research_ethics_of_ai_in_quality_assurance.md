    "summary_of_findings": "The ethics of AI in quality assurance span multiple industries, including manufacturing, healthcare, aerospace, and logistics. Automated Final Inspection Systems (AFIS) leverage AI, IoT, and robotics to enhance efficiency, reduce defects, and ensure compliance. However, ethical challenges include job displacement, algorithmic bias, data privacy, and transparency. Regulatory frameworks like ISO 9001, FDA guidelines, and the EU AI Act shape AI-driven quality control. Recent advancements include quantum computing integration, blockchain for audit trails, and real-time data analytics. Aerospace applications emphasize safety-critical protocols, while pharmaceuticals focus on traceability and compliance. Ethical considerations require balancing technological benefits with societal impacts.",
