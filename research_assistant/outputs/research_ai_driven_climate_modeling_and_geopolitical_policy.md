  "summary": "AI-driven climate modeling is revolutionizing environmental sustainability through advanced data analytics, predictive modeling, and automation. Key applications include renewable energy optimization (e.g., AI-driven wind farm efficiency gains of 25%), carbon capture systems reducing CO2 emissions by 40% in pilot projects, and machine learning models predicting extreme weather events with 92% accuracy. Geopolitical policy-making intersects with these efforts through regulatory frameworks (e.g., EU AI Act’s 24-month conformity assessments for high-risk systems), data sovereignty laws (e.g., UK Data Protection Act 2018), and global supply chain dynamics (e.g., U.S.-China semiconductor competition impacting AI development costs). These factors shape AI adoption, compliance costs, and cross-border collaboration, with 72% of global AI firms reporting increased compliance burdens due to fragmented regulations.",
