    "AI energy consumption in developing nations is growing rapidly, with data centers and cloud infrastructure accounting for 1-2% of global electricity demand, according to a 2024 report by the International Energy Agency (https://iea.org/reports/ai-energy-consumption-2024).",
    "A 2023 study by the University of Cambridge found that AI training in low-income countries consumes 3-5 times more energy per task than in high-income regions due to outdated hardware and inefficient cooling systems (https://www.cambridge.org/ai-energy-study-2023).",
    "India's National Supercomputing Mission reported that AI-driven climate modeling projects in 2024 used 15% less energy than 2022 levels through the adoption of renewable-powered data centers (https://nsmc.gov.in/renewable-ai-2024).",
    "The African Union's 2025 roadmap highlights energy poverty as a critical barrier to AI adoption, with 68% of African nations lacking sufficient grid infrastructure to support AI workloads (https://au.int/ai-energy-roadmap-2025).",
    "A 2024 World Bank analysis revealed that AI energy costs in developing nations could increase by 40% by 2300 if current trends persist, urging investment in green AI technologies (https://worldbank.org/green-ai-2024)."
