Based on my research, the AI job market is expected to grow significantly in the United States by 2026. According to various sources:

- CNBC survey of HR leaders found that nearly 9 out of 10 expect AI to reshape jobs in 2026.
- The NACE (National Association of Colleges and Employers) predicts a 1.6% increase in hiring for the Class of 2026 compared to 2025, aligning with tight labor market conditions.
- PwC analyzed job ads from six continents and found that AI is having an impact on jobs globally.

Some emerging AI job roles expected in 2026 include:

- Machine Learning Engineer
- Artificial Intelligence Engineer 
- Research Scientist (AI)
- Data Scientist
- Robotics Engineer

The U.S. labor market forecast suggests job openings may stabilize but unemployment is likely to rise slightly, while GDP growth remains positive but modest.

In terms of the number of jobs impacted by AI, estimates vary widely:
- McKinsey estimates up to 40% of US professions could be replaced by AI by 2030.
- Other sources predict that as many as 30% of jobs could be automated by 2030.

Overall, while there will likely be job displacement due to AI, it is also expected to create new roles and transform existing ones.
