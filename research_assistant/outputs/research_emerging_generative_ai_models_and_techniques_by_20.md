    "summary": "By 2026, generative AI models have advanced significantly, with breakthroughs in multimodal capabilities, efficiency, and specialized applications. Key developments include models like GPT-5, PaLM 5, and LLaMA 3, which demonstrate enhanced reasoning, code generation, and cross-modal understanding. Techniques such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), sparse training, and neural architecture search (NAS) are driving performance gains. According to a 2025 report by PwC, generative AI could contribute $1.2 trillion to the global economy by 2027. Experts like Fei-Fei Li emphasize the importance of aligning AI with human values, while challenges like energy consumption and ethical risks remain critical areas of focus. Notable trends include the rise of agentic AI systems, AI sovereignty initiatives, and integration with quantum computing.",
