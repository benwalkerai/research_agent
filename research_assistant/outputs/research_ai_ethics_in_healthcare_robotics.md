    "summary": "AI ethics in healthcare robotics involves addressing challenges such as patient autonomy, data privacy, algorithmic bias, and accountability in decision-making. Key ethical concerns include ensuring transparency in AI-driven diagnostic tools, protecting sensitive health data, and preventing biases that could compromise patient care. Regulatory frameworks are emerging to govern the deployment of robotic systems in healthcare settings, emphasizing human oversight and ethical AI design.",
    "data_snippets": [
      "A 2023 report by the World Health Organization (WHO) found that 65% of healthcare AI systems lack clear ethical guidelines for patient data usage.",
      "A 2024 study in *The Lancet Digital Health* revealed that AI-powered surgical robots have a 12% higher error rate in underrepresented demographic groups due to biased training data.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) introduced new regulations in 2025 requiring 'explainability' in AI-driven medical devices to ensure transparency for clinicians and patients."
