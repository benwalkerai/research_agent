    "Summary of Findings": "By 2026, global efforts to establish AI ethics, regulations, and standards are accelerating, driven by cross-border collaboration, industry self-regulation, and government mandates. Key developments include the adoption of risk-based frameworks for high-impact AI systems, mandatory bias audits, and standardized transparency protocols. The EU’s AI Act (2025) and the US NIST AI Risk Management Framework (2025) are foundational, while emerging standards focus on explainability, data privacy, and accountability. Industry-specific regulations in healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems are gaining traction, alongside global initiatives like the OECD AI Principles 2.0.",
