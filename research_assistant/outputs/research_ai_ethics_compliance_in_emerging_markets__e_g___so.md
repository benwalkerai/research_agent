  "Research Notes": {
    "Summary of Findings": "AI ethics compliance in Southeast Asia (e.g., Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand) is shaped by a mix of regional regulations, multinational corporate policies, and emerging local frameworks. Key developments include the ASEAN Digital Economy Roadmap (2025) emphasizing data privacy, Indonesia’s Ministry of Communication’s AI Governance Guidelines (2025), and Vietnam’s draft AI Ethics Framework (2026). Challenges include fragmented regional standards, limited enforcement capacity, and balancing foreign tech巨头 influence with local sovereignty. Companies like Google and Meta have established AI ethics councils in the region, while startups are adopting hybrid compliance models combining global standards (e.g., OECD AI Principles) with regional data laws (e.g., Indonesia’s Data Protection Law 2023).",
