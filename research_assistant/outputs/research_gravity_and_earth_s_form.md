Earth's shape is primarily an oblate spheroid due to its rotation causing the equator to bulge outward. This form is well-supported by scientific evidence from NASA, Sciencemag, and other credible sources, which confirm that while there are slight variations in the gravitational field beyond simple poles flattening, the overall shape remains an oblate spheroid with a larger equatorial radius compared to polar regions.

**SUGGESTED_FURTHER_RESEARCH:**
1. Investigate how tectonic movements influence Earth's shape and geometry over time.
2. Explore gravitational anomalies' impact on minor shape variations beyond the standard model.
3. Review historical measurements contributing to understanding Earth's oblate spheroid form as an oblate spheroid.
4. Analyze recent satellite data like GRACE mission results for geoid variations influenced by gravity.

These further investigations provide deeper insights into Earth's geometric form and any changes or factors affecting it.
