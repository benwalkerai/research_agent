    "summary": "By 2026, advancements in AI ethics and responsible development have focused on creating transparent, accountable, and equitable AI systems. Key developments include the adoption of explainable AI (XAI) frameworks, global regulatory standards like the EU AI Act, and the rise of AI impact assessments. Major initiatives include the OECD AI Principles and the establishment of AI ethics boards in tech firms. Techniques such as bias mitigation algorithms, fairness-aware machine learning, and auditable AI systems are now standard in deployment pipelines. According to a 2025 report by McKinsey, 65% of enterprises have implemented ethical AI governance frameworks. Experts like ethicist Cathy O'Neil highlight the need for algorithmic transparency, while challenges like data privacy and AI accountability remain central to discussions. Trends include the integration of AI ethics into product design, public-private partnerships for oversight, and the development of AI audit tools.",
