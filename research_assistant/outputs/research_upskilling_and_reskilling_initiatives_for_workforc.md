**Regulatory & Ethical Developments in 2026:**

1. **EU AI Act Implementation:**  
   - Full enforcement by 2026, with risk-based regulation for high-risk systems (e.g., biometric identification, law enforcement).  
   - Compliance deadlines for specific applications (e.g., 2024–2026 for facial recognition and recruitment tools).  

2. **Global AI Governance Frameworks:**  
   - Proposals for standardized ethical audits, cross-border data sharing protocols, and international cooperation on AI safety standards (World Economic Forum).  
   - IEEE’s 2026 ethics guidelines emphasizing transparency, accountability, and bias mitigation in AI systems.  

3. **Corporate Responsibility:**  
   - Google’s 2026 update prioritizing third-party audits, reduced environmental impact, and equitable AI access.  
   - MIT Technology Review highlights regulatory pressure on developers to embed explainable AI (XAI) and ethical risk assessments into product lifecycles.
