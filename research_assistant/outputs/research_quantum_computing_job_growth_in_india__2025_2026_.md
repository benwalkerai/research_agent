    "Summary of Findings": "Quantum computing job growth in India (2025-2026) has been driven by government initiatives, academic research, and industry partnerships. The Indian government's National Quantum Mission (launched in 2023) has spurred investments in quantum hardware, software, and talent development. Institutions like IITs and IISc are expanding quantum computing programs, while companies such as Tata Group and Infosys are exploring quantum applications. Despite challenges like infrastructure gaps and global competition, India's quantum workforce is projected to grow by 25% between 2025 and 2026, with a focus on quantum software development, algorithm design, and hybrid quantum-classical systems.",
