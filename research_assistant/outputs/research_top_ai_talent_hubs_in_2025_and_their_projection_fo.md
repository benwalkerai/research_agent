2. **AI Adoption**:  
   - AI adoption is rising, with PwC noting a 25% adoption rate in 2024.  
   - AI could replace 2 million manufacturing jobs by 2026 but may also create 97 million new jobs globally by 2025.  

3. **Economic Impact**:

5. **Further Research Areas**:  
   - The data suggests gaps in understanding AI talent hubs, regional job market growth comparisons (e.g., North America, Europe, Asia), and the role of regulations (e.g., EU’s AI Act, U.S. Algorithmic Accountability Act).  

For specific AI talent hubs, additional data or targeted research would be required. The current dataset focuses on macroeconomic and industry-wide trends rather than geographic concentrations of talent.
