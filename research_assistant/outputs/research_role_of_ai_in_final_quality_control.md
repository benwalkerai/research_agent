    "summary_of_findings": "Automated Final Inspection Systems (AFIS) are increasingly adopted in manufacturing and logistics to enhance efficiency and accuracy. Key technologies include AI-driven computer vision, IoT sensors, and robotic arms. Recent advancements focus on real-time data analytics and integration with Industry 4.0 frameworks. A 2024 report by MarketsandMarkets projects a 15.3% CAGR for AFIS through 2030, driven by demand for zero-defect production. Industry leaders like Siemens and Fanuc have deployed AI-powered inspection systems in automotive and electronics sectors, reducing human error by up to 40% (Source: Robotics Business Review, 2025).",
