### Research Notes

**Overview:**
- Industries such as healthcare, finance, manufacturing, retail, and logistics are expected to be significantly affected by AI adoption in 2026.
- Automation will likely transform or automate around half of jobs, with full dominance possible by 2050.

**Key Industries Impacted:**
1. **Healthcare**: AI is expected to enhance diagnostics, treatment planning, and patient care. However, it may also lead to the automation of some administrative tasks.
2. **Finance**: AI can streamline processes such as fraud detection, risk assessment, and customer service, but it could automate certain roles like loan underwriters or back-office staff.
3. **Manufacturing**: AI-driven robots and systems will increase efficiency in production lines, potentially leading to job displacement for roles that are highly routine.
4. **Retail**: Personalization and inventory management can be greatly improved by AI, but it may reduce the need for human cashiers and stock clerks.
5. **Logistics**: Automated warehouses and delivery services can enhance efficiency, but they could lead to reduced demand for manual labor.

**Additional Insights:**
- Full dominance (80% and higher) of jobs by AI is possible by 2050, assuming steady innovation.
- The top industries most affected are healthcare, finance, manufacturing, retail, and logistics.
- Research from Nexford University suggests that around two-thirds of U.S. and European jobs could be "exposed to some degree of AI automation."
- A Goldman Sachs report predicts that AI could displace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs worldwide by 2030.
