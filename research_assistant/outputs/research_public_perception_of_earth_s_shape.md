The Earth's shape is primarily an oblate spheroid due to its rotation, causing the equator to bulge outward. This form is well-supported by multiple sources:

1. **NASA's Earth Features**: Confirms Earth as an oblate spheroid with an equatorial radius of approximately 6,378 km and a polar radius of about 6,356 km.
2. **Scientific Studies**: Recent studies suggest minor variations in the gravitational field beyond simple poles flattening.

**Suggested Further Research:**
1. Investigate how rotational forces specifically influence Earth's shape and bulge.
2. Explore gravitational anomalies' impact on minor shape variations.
3. Review historical measurements contributing to understanding Earth's oblate spheroid form.

These further investigations would provide deeper insights into Earth's geometric form and any changes or factors affecting it.
