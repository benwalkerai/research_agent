    "Summary of Findings": "Federated learning (FL) scalability challenges in 2026 revolve around communication overhead, non-IID data distribution, model aggregation inefficiencies, and resource constraints across decentralized devices. Key developments include advances in compressed communication protocols, edge computing optimizations, and hybrid FL-centralized architectures. Industry adoption faces hurdles in coordinating thousands of devices, ensuring data privacy compliance (e.g., GDPR), and maintaining model accuracy with heterogeneous data. Academic research highlights the role of AI-driven meta-learning and blockchain for trust in FL systems.",
