The Earth's shape is best described as an oblate spheroid due to its rotation causing the equator to bulge outward. This is supported by multiple sources including NASA and Sciencemag, which confirm this shape despite minor variations in gravitational anomalies.

**Answer:**

Earth's shape is confirmed to be an oblate spheroid, primarily because of its rotation leading to an equatorial bulge. This form is well-supported by scientific evidence from NASA, Sciencemag, and other sources, which indicate that while there are slight variations due to the gravitational field, the overall shape remains an oblate spheroid with a larger equatorial radius compared to polar regions.

**SUGGESTED_FURTHER_RESEARCH:**
1. **Geophysical Effects of Earth's Rotation:** Investigate how rotational forces specifically influence the shape and bulge of Earth.
2. **Variations in Gravitational Field Impact:** Explore how gravitational anomalies affect the minor shape variations beyond the standard oblate spheroid.
3. **Historical Studies on Earth's Shape:** Review historical measurements and studies that contributed to understanding Earth's shape as an oblate spheroid.

These further investigations would provide deeper insights into why Earth maintains its specific geometric form and any subsequent changes or factors affecting it.
