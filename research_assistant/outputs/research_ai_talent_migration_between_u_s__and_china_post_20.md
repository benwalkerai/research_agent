    "Summary of Findings": "AI talent migration between the U.S. and China post-2025 has been shaped by geopolitical dynamics, corporate strategies, and regulatory shifts. Key trends include a surge in U.S.-based talent moving to China for state-funded R&D opportunities, while Chinese professionals seek U.S. hubs for advanced AI infrastructure and academic collaboration. Remote work and hybrid models have accelerated cross-border mobility, though U.S. visa restrictions and China’s data localization laws create friction. The U.S. remains a top destination for AI talent due to its venture capital ecosystem and innovation hubs, while China’s AI Development Plan 2025 has bolstered domestic talent retention. Regulatory divergence, such as the EU’s AI Act and U.S. Algorithmic Accountability Act, further influences migration patterns by affecting compliance costs and research freedoms.",
