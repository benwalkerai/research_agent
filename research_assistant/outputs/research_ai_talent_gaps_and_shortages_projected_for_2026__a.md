  "Research Notes": {
    "Summary of Findings": "AI talent gaps and shortages projected for 2026 are driven by rapid advancements in quantum computing, agentic AI, and federated learning, which require specialized skills. Global demand for AI ethics compliance, quantum AI expertise, and federated learning specialists is outpacing supply, exacerbated by geopolitical fragmentation and regional talent silos. Potential solutions include upskilling programs, cross-border collaboration, and regulatory harmonization to address skill shortages and talent migration challenges.",
