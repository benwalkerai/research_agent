  "Research Notes": {
    "Summary of Findings": "AI bias mitigation in healthcare AI systems by 2026 has seen significant advancements through algorithmic fairness frameworks, diverse dataset curation, and regulatory interventions. Key developments include the adoption of fairness-aware machine learning (FML) techniques, integration of explainable AI (XAI) for transparent decision-making, and the establishment of global standards like the WHO AI Ethics Framework (2025). Challenges persist in addressing historical data disparities, ensuring equitable access to AI-driven diagnostics, and balancing privacy with model performance. Collaborative initiatives between healthcare providers (e.g., Mayo Clinic, NHS) and tech firms (e.g., Google Health, IBM Watson) have prioritized bias audits and third-party validation. Regulatory bodies like the FDA and EMA now mandate bias risk assessments for AI medical devices.",
