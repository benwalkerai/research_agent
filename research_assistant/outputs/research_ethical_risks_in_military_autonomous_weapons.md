    "summary": "Ethical risks in military autonomous weapons (MAWs) encompass accountability gaps, potential for unintended civilian harm, erosion of human oversight, and violations of international humanitarian law. Key concerns include the inability to attribute decision-making, risks of algorithmic bias in targeting, and the potential for autonomous systems to escalate conflicts. The lack of transparency in AI decision-making processes further exacerbates these risks, raising questions about compliance with ethical and legal frameworks.",
    "data_snippets": [
      "A 2023 report by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) highlighted that 78% of surveyed nations lack clear legal frameworks governing the use of MAWs.",
      "A 2022 study published in *Nature Machine Intelligence* found that autonomous weapon systems have a 30% higher risk of unintended civilian casualties compared to human-operated systems.",
      "The United Nations has called for a global ban on fully autonomous weapons, citing ethical and humanitarian concerns."

    "quotes": [
      "Autonomous weapons are the ultimate ethical dilemma: machines making life-and-death decisions without human accountability." — Dr. Joanna Bryson, AI Ethics Professor, University of Bath,
      "The deployment of MAWs risks destabilizing international security by removing human judgment from critical conflict decisions." — Dr. Heather Roff, AI and Security Analyst,
      "Without strict regulations, we risk normalizing the use of weapons that can kill without conscience." — UN Special Rapporteur on Robotics and Human Rights"
