### Suggested Further Research

1. **Effects of Mantle Convection on Geoid Variations**: Investigating how dynamic processes within the Earth's mantle affect satellite-measured geoid data.
2. **Satellite Data Analysis Beyond GRACE**: Exploring other missions and datasets contributing to geoid analysis accuracy.
3. **Historical Trends in Geoid Changes Over Decades**: Reviewing long-term studies to understand cumulative effects of tectonic movements over time.

These further investigations will provide deeper insights into Earth's geometric form and the factors influencing its shape changes.
