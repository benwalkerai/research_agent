Based on my research, several key AI regulatory frameworks are expected to be implemented globally by 2026. Here is a summary of the most significant ones:

### European Union (EU)
- **AI Act**: The EU's comprehensive legal framework for regulating artificial intelligence will enter full applicability on August 2, 2026. This includes requirements such as risk assessment, transparency obligations, and specific bans or high-risk categories like social scoring systems.

### United States
- As of the time of this search, there are no finalized federal regulations specific to AI. However, state and local governments have been enacting various AI-related laws.

### Additional Resources
- **AI Regulatory Sandbox**: Each EU Member State must establish at least one national-level AI regulatory sandbox by August 2, 2026.

### Key Points for Compliance and Implementation
1. **Risk Assessment**: Organizations should assess the potential risks of their AI systems and comply with transparency obligations.
2. **High-Risk Categories**: Specific categories like social scoring systems will be banned or require extensive compliance measures.
3. **Regulatory Sandboxes**: Establishing a sandbox can provide testing environments to ensure compliance before full-scale deployment.

These regulatory frameworks are expected to significantly impact how businesses interact with and deploy AI, so it is crucial for organizations to stay informed and prepare accordingly.
