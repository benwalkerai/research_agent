    "organisation_structure": "Professional services teams (e.g., consulting, legal, IT) typically adopt matrix or functional hierarchies. Consulting firms often use a hybrid model combining project-based teams (led by senior consultants) with functional departments (e.g., strategy, analytics). Leadership structures vary: some firms use a 'partner-led' hierarchy with senior partners overseeing practice areas, while others adopt flat structures with data-driven decision-making.",
    "key_features": [
      "Tiered expertise: Entry-level analysts → mid-level specialists → senior consultants/leads",
      "Client-facing vs. back-office roles: Account managers, project managers, and support staff",
      "Cross-functional collaboration: Integration of technical experts (e.g., data scientists) with business advisors"
    ],
    "recent_developments": "Post-pandemic, many firms have emphasized agile team structures with remote collaboration tools. AI integration in team workflows (e.g., automated reporting tools) is reshaping traditional hierarchies.",
