**Critical Gaps in the Data:**  
- **Top AI Talent Hubs (2025–2026)**: The dataset does not explicitly mention geographic concentrations of AI talent (e.g., Silicon Valley, Berlin, or other hubs).  
- **Regional Job Market Comparisons**: While macroeconomic trends are detailed, there is no analysis of **regional disparities** (e.g., North America vs. Europe vs. Asia).  
- **Regulatory Impact**: The **EU’s AI Act** and the **U.S. Algorithmic Accountability Act** are highlighted in suggested research but lack specific data on their projected effects on employment.

**Conclusion**:  
The dataset provides a robust overview of AI’s macroeconomic and workforce impacts but lacks granular details on talent hubs, regional disparities, and regulatory outcomes. To address these gaps, targeted research is essential to inform policy, education, and industry strategies for a resilient AI-driven economy.
