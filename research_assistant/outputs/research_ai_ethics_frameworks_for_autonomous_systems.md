    "Summary of Findings": "AI ethics frameworks for autonomous systems focus on ensuring transparency, accountability, and safety in AI decision-making. Key developments include the EU's Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI (2019), the IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous Systems (2020), and the OECD AI Principles (2021). By 2026, frameworks are increasingly addressing risks in autonomous vehicles, drones, and healthcare AI. Talent gaps in ethics compliance and AI governance are growing, with demand for professionals skilled in regulatory standards (e.g., ISO/IEC 24028) and impact assessments.",
