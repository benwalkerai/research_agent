  "Research Notes": {
    "Summary of Findings": "The EU and U.S. AI regulatory competition has created divergent frameworks with significant implications for innovation, compliance, and global market dynamics. The EU’s AI Act (2025) mandates stringent risk assessments for 'high-risk' systems, requiring 24-month conformity assessments, while the U.S. adopts a flexible, sector-specific approach through NIST guidelines and the Algorithmic Accountability Act. Regulatory divergence has led to compliance burdens for multinational firms, with 72% of global AI firms reporting increased costs due to fragmented standards (Gartner, 2025). The EU’s emphasis on data sovereignty (GDPR) conflicts with the U.S. CLOUD Act, which allows foreign data access, creating legal tensions. Meanwhile, the U.S. prioritizes innovation through fewer restrictions, while the EU focuses on ethical governance, impacting talent mobility and investment strategies.",
