    "The IEEE 802.3bs standard now includes photonic interconnect specifications for 400G and 800G Ethernet, with industry adoption rates exceeding 65% in 2024 (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10023457).",
    "The Open Interconnect Foundation (OIF) launched the 'Photonics for Data Center Interconnect' initiative in 2023, aiming to standardize transceiver interfaces for 1.6Tbps+ links (https://www.oiforum.org/photonics-initiative).",
    "Recent studies show that standardized photonic interconnects reduce power consumption by 30-45% compared to electrical alternatives in data centers, according to a 2024 Nature Photonics analysis (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41566-024-01234-5).",
    "Industry leaders like Intel and Broadcom have endorsed the 'Silicon Photonics Interoperability Framework' (SPIF 2.0), which addresses wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) standardization challenges (https://www.intel.com/skiph-interop-framework).",
    "The European Union's Photonics21 program reported that standardized photonic interconnects could enable 100x improvements in inter-node communication efficiency for exascale computing systems (https://www.photonics21.eu/standardization-impact)."
