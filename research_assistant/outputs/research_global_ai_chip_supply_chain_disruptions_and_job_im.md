    "Summary of Findings": "Global AI chip supply chain disruptions have intensified due to geopolitical tensions, raw material shortages, and manufacturing concentration in key regions like Taiwan and South Korea. These disruptions have led to increased costs, delayed AI development projects, and shifts in job markets, with demand for semiconductor engineers, supply chain analysts, and regional compliance officers rising. However, automation and diversification efforts are reshaping roles in AI chip design and production.",
