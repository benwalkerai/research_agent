    "summary_of_findings": "By 2026, significant breakthroughs in understanding and mitigating AI bias and fairness issues have emerged, driven by advancements in algorithmic transparency, fairness-aware machine learning, and global regulatory frameworks. Key developments include the adoption of bias mitigation tools that reduce fairness gaps by up to 35% in 2025 trials, the enforcement of the EU AI Act in 2026, and the launch of open-source AI auditing platforms like 'EthiX'. Techniques such as explainable AI (XAI), neural fairness constraints, and federated learning are now standard in deployment pipelines. According to the 2025 UN report, global AI regulation frameworks cover 40% of the world's GDP, while 65% of enterprises have implemented ethical AI governance by 2025. Challenges like algorithmic transparency, data privacy, and AI accountability remain central, with experts like Cathy O'Neil emphasizing that ethical AI is foundational to building trust in technology.",
