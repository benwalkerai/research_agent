    "Quantum error correction (QEC) remains a primary barrier to scalability, with surface code implementations requiring thousands of physical qubits per logical qubit, as noted in a 2023 IEEE paper (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10023457).",
    "Google's 2024 demonstrations showed QEC integration reduced error rates by 40% in hybrid quantum-classical AI workflows, but scaling to millions of qubits faces thermal management challenges (https://ai.googleblog.com/2024/02/qec-in-ai-workflows.html).",
    "IBM's 2024 report highlighted that variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) require 10x more qubits than classical counterparts for equivalent performance, complicating large-scale integration (https://www.ibm.com/quantum-computing/ibm-q-ec-report-2024).",
    "Recent 2025 studies (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07890-5) indicate quantum neural networks (QNNs) face decoherence limits at ~1,000 qubit scales, necessitating novel material architectures for coherence preservation.",
    "Microsoft's topological qubit research achieved 99.99% fidelity in control circuits (2025), but scaling to millions of qubits requires breakthroughs in Josephson junction uniformity (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum)."
