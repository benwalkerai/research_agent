Thought: I have gathered various articles, resources, and information on Machine Learning Models in 2026. Now, I will compile the summaries of findings, create a list of URLs visited, and suggest further research topics if applicable.

Action:
- Create a summary of main findings from the search results.
- Compile a list of all relevant URLs.
- Suggest related sub-topics for further investigation.
