    "Summary of Findings": "Geopolitical dynamics between 2025-2026 have significantly shaped the AI job market through regulatory fragmentation, technology competition, and regional alliances. The EU’s AI Act (2025) and U.S. NIST frameworks prioritize compliance and ethical standards, creating demand for AI ethics auditors and regulators. China’s export controls on AI chips and focus on domestic innovation have shifted job growth toward Asia-Pacific, while U.S.-China tech decoupling spurred investments in quantum computing and agentic AI in North America. The U.K.’s post-Brexit data sovereignty laws and India’s National Strategy for AI (2025) further fragmented global AI labor markets, emphasizing regional specialization in quantum AI, federated learning, and ethical compliance.",
