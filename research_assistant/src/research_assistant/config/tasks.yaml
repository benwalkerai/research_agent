research_execution_task:
  description: >
    Conduct extensive web searches for the specific topic: "{research_topic}".
    Gather information, statistics, quotes, and recent developments.
    Ensure you capture source URLs for verification.
    If you discover important related sub-topics that require separate investigation, list them clearly at the end of your report formatted as a JSON list (e.g., ["Topic 1", "Topic 2"]) within a block labeled 'SUGGESTED_FURTHER_RESEARCH'.
  expected_output: >
    A concise collection of high-quality research notes for "{research_topic}".
    Include key findings, data points, and visited URLs.
    CRITICAL: All URLs must be formatted as Markdown links: [Source Title/hostname](URL).
    Include a 'SUGGESTED_FURTHER_RESEARCH' block if applicable.

  description: >
    Review the raw research notes. Deduplicate information, resolve any conflicting data points,
    and organize the findings into logical categories. Verify the facts against the sources provided.
  expected_output: >
    A dense, structured 'Fact Brief'. Deduplicate and verify all facts.
    Organize findings into concise bullet points and logical categories.
    Ensure every byte of information is high-value.

publishing_task:
  description: >
    Review all research outputs and verify factual claims. For each significant claim:
    1. Identify the source citation
    2. Assess source credibility and recency
    3. Cross-reference with other sources
    4. Flag any unsupported statements, outdated information, or conflicting data
    Consider the current year {current_year} for temporal context.
  expected_output: >
    A detailed validation report with: verified facts (marked ✓), flagged concerns (marked ⚠️),
    and critical issues requiring additional research (marked ❌). 
    CRITICAL: If any ⚠️ or ❌ are present, you MUST include a block labeled 'REQUIRED_RESEARCH' 
    at the end with a JSON list of specific search queries to resolve the issues.
    Every single cited source must be listed as a standard Markdown link: [Source Title/hostname](URL).

fact_checking_task:
  description: >
    Review the final research content. Verify all facts, citations, and sources.
    Cross-reference with the Fact Brief and ensure accuracy.
  expected_output: >
    A final, polished Markdown file content, formatted perfectly for publication.
    CRITICAL: You MUST include a dedicated "Sources" section at the end of the report.

critical_analysis_task:
  description: >
    Critically evaluate the research data for:
    1. Evidence Quality: Are claims backed by strong, recent, credible sources?
    2. Completeness: Are counter-arguments and opposing views represented?
    3. Bias Detection: Is there cherry-picking of data or one-sided presentation?
    4. Hallucination Risks: Are there suspiciously specific claims without sources?
    5. Logical Soundness: Are there gaps in reasoning or unsupported conclusions?
  expected_output: >
    A critical analysis report identifying: weak evidence areas, missing counter-perspectives,
    potential biases, and specific research gaps to fill. Rate overall quality (1-10).
    CRITICAL: If the quality rating is below 7, you MUST include a block labeled 'REQUIRED_RESEARCH'
    at the end with a JSON list of specific search queries to fill the identified gaps.
